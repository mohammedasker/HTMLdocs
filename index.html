			<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
			
			<p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</p>
			
			<code>
				<quote>My cat is very grumpy</quote>
			</code>
			<p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>

			<p>The main parts of our element are as follows:

			   <li>1. <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>

			   <li>2. <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>

			   <li>3. <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>

			   <li>4. <b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.</li>

			Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
